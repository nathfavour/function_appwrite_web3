# Quick Reference: API Key Migration

## What Changed?

**One line of code changed** in `src/auth-handler.ts`:

```typescript
// Before
const apiKey = process.env.APPWRITE_API_KEY;

// After  
const apiKey = process.env.APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY || process.env.APPWRITE_API_KEY;
```

## What This Means

### For Existing Deployments (with APPWRITE_API_KEY set)
- ✅ **Nothing breaks** - your function continues to work
- ✅ No action required
- ✅ API calls remain unchanged

### For New Deployments
- ✅ **No manual API key setup needed**
- ✅ Appwrite automatically provides `APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY`
- ✅ Simpler deployment process

## API Compatibility

| Aspect | Status |
|--------|--------|
| API Endpoints | ✅ Unchanged |
| Request Format | ✅ Unchanged |
| Response Format | ✅ Unchanged |
| Error Codes | ✅ Unchanged |
| Client Integration | ✅ Unchanged |
| Third-party Apps | ✅ No changes needed |

## Behavior Matrix

| Environment | APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY | APPWRITE_API_KEY | Result |
|-------------|---------------------------|------------------|---------|
| **New** | ✅ Auto-provided | - | Uses built-in key ✓ |
| **Legacy** | - | ✅ Manually set | Uses legacy key ✓ |
| **Both** | ✅ Auto-provided | ✅ Manually set | Uses built-in key (preferred) ✓ |
| **Neither** | - | - | Error (misconfiguration) ✗ |

## Do I Need To Do Anything?

### If you have existing deployments:
**No.** Your functions will continue to work exactly as before.

### If you're deploying a new function:
**No.** Just deploy normally. The API key is provided automatically.

### If you want to clean up:
**Optional.** You can remove `APPWRITE_API_KEY` from your environment variables, but there's no rush.

## Support

Questions? Check the `/ping` endpoint to verify your function is working:
```bash
curl https://YOUR_ENDPOINT/v1/functions/web3-auth/executions \
  -X POST \
  -H "X-Appwrite-Project: YOUR_PROJECT_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path": "/ping"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "Web3 Authentication",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## Bottom Line

✅ **Zero breaking changes**  
✅ **Existing apps work unchanged**  
✅ **New deployments simplified**  
✅ **Backward compatible**  
✅ **Production ready**
