# Appwrite Function Environment Variables
# 
# These variables are automatically provided by Appwrite Functions runtime:
# - APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_ENDPOINT (e.g., https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1)
# - APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID (your project ID)
# - APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY (automatically generated API key with function permissions)
#
# ⚠️ You don't need to set them manually when deploying to Appwrite.
#
# Note: The function automatically uses APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY (built-in).
# For backward compatibility, it falls back to APPWRITE_API_KEY if the built-in key is not available.
#
# For local testing with Appwrite CLI, these are auto-injected.
