# Appwrite Function Environment Variables
# 
# These variables are automatically provided by Appwrite Functions runtime:
# - APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_ENDPOINT (e.g., https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1)
# - APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID (your project ID)
#
# ⚠️ You don't need to set them manually when deploying to Appwrite.
#
# For local testing with Appwrite CLI, these are auto-injected.
# The API key is passed via the x-appwrite-key request header, not env vars.
