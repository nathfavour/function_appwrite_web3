## Deployment Options

### Option 1: No Action (Recommended) ‚úÖ
**Status:** Ready to use  
**Risk:** Zero  
**Existing Deployments:** Continue working with APPWRITE_API_KEY  
**New Deployments:** Automatically use APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY  

#### Steps:
- [ ] None required - code is backward compatible

---

### Option 2: Deploy Update (When Ready)

#### Staging Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Test health check endpoint (`/ping`)
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify user creation
- [ ] Verify wallet binding
- [ ] Check function logs
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours

#### Production Deployment
- [ ] Deploy to production
- [ ] Test health check endpoint (`/ping`)
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Monitor function logs
- [ ] Keep `APPWRITE_API_KEY` as backup (optional)
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours

#### Post-Deployment (Optional Cleanup)
- [ ] Verify function using built-in key (check logs)
- [ ] Remove `APPWRITE_API_KEY` from environment variables
- [ ] Redeploy function
- [ ] Test thoroughly
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours

---

## Testing Checklist

### Health Check Test
```bash
curl YOUR_ENDPOINT/v1/functions/web3-auth/executions \
  -X POST \
  -H "X-Appwrite-Project: PROJECT_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"path": "/ping"}'
```

Expected Response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "Web3 Authentication",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

- [ ] Returns 200 status code
- [ ] Returns valid JSON
- [ ] Contains expected fields

### Authentication Flow Test

#### Step 1: Connect Wallet
```javascript
const accounts = await window.ethereum.request({ 
  method: 'eth_requestAccounts' 
});
const address = accounts[0];
```

- [ ] Wallet connection successful

#### Step 2: Sign Message
```javascript
const message = `auth-${Date.now()}`;
const fullMessage = `Sign this message to authenticate: ${message}`;
const signature = await window.ethereum.request({
  method: 'personal_sign',
  params: [fullMessage, address]
});
```

- [ ] Message signed successfully

#### Step 3: Call Function
```javascript
import { Client, Functions } from 'appwrite';

const client = new Client()
  .setEndpoint('YOUR_ENDPOINT')
  .setProject('YOUR_PROJECT');

const functions = new Functions(client);

const execution = await functions.createExecution(
  'web3-auth',
  JSON.stringify({ email, address, signature, message }),
  false
);

const result = JSON.parse(execution.responseBody);
```

- [ ] Function execution successful
- [ ] Returns `userId` field
- [ ] Returns `secret` field
- [ ] Response format matches expected structure

#### Step 4: Create Session
```javascript
import { Account } from 'appwrite';

const account = new Account(client);
await account.createSession(result.userId, result.secret);
```

- [ ] Session created successfully
- [ ] User authenticated

### Error Handling Tests

#### Test 1: Invalid Signature
- [ ] Returns 401 status
- [ ] Returns error message
- [ ] Does not create user

#### Test 2: Missing Fields
- [ ] Returns 400 status
- [ ] Returns error message
- [ ] Does not create user

#### Test 3: Wallet Conflict
- [ ] Returns 403 status
- [ ] Returns appropriate error message
- [ ] Prevents wallet switching

### Log Verification
- [ ] Check Appwrite Console ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Web3 Auth ‚Üí Logs
- [ ] Verify no "Server configuration error" messages
- [ ] Verify successful authentication messages
- [ ] Verify proper API key usage (built-in or legacy)

---

## Monitoring Checklist

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor error rate (should remain stable)
- [ ] Monitor execution success rate (should remain ~100%)
- [ ] Monitor response times (should remain consistent)
- [ ] Check for "Server configuration error" (should be zero)
- [ ] Review function logs periodically

### First Week
- [ ] Compare metrics with previous week (should be identical)
- [ ] Check user creation rate (should be stable)
- [ ] Verify no increase in error reports
- [ ] Confirm third-party apps still working

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Method 1: Git Revert
```bash
# If issues occur after deployment
cd /home/user/function_appwrite_web3
git revert HEAD
npm run build
appwrite deploy function
```

- [ ] Code reverted to previous version
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] Deployment successful
- [ ] Function working normally

### Method 2: Re-Enable Legacy Key
```bash
# Keep updated code, but use legacy key
# In Appwrite Console:
# Functions ‚Üí Web3 Auth ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
# Add: APPWRITE_API_KEY = your_api_key
```

- [ ] Environment variable set
- [ ] Function redeployed (or auto-reloaded)
- [ ] Function working with legacy key
- [ ] Fallback mechanism confirmed working

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Server configuration error"
**Symptoms:** Function returns 500 error with configuration message

**Diagnosis:**
- [ ] Check: Is `APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_KEY` available?
- [ ] Check: Is `APPWRITE_API_KEY` set (for legacy)?
- [ ] Check: Function logs in Appwrite Console

**Resolution:**
- [ ] For Appwrite Cloud: Contact support if built-in key missing
- [ ] For self-hosted: Verify Appwrite version (‚â•1.4)
- [ ] Temporary: Set `APPWRITE_API_KEY` manually

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors
**Symptoms:** Function fails during user operations

**Diagnosis:**
- [ ] Check: API key permissions in console
- [ ] Verify: `users.read`, `users.write`, `sessions.write`

**Resolution:**
- [ ] Built-in keys should have correct permissions automatically
- [ ] For legacy keys: Update permissions in console

### Issue: Function not responding
**Symptoms:** Timeouts or no response

**Diagnosis:**
- [ ] Check: Function deployment status
- [ ] Check: Function logs for errors
- [ ] Check: Network connectivity
- [ ] Test: Health check endpoint (`/ping`)

**Resolution:**
- [ ] Redeploy function if deployment failed
- [ ] Check Appwrite service status
- [ ] Verify function execution permissions
